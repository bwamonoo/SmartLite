### Project Overview
We are developing **SmartLite**, a smart lighting system designed to enhance energy efficiency. The system automatically illuminates a room when it senses the presence of a person. The lights seamlessly turn off as soon as the last person leaves the room, ensuring that energy is conserved without any manual intervention.
